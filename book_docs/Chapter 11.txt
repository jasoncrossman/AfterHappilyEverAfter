WHOLENESS 

“Happiness is not a matter of intensity but balance, order, rhythm, and harmony.” -  Thomas Merton

What is the purpose of our human endeavors and our efforts to achieve greatness if we cannot find a way to bring ourselves into balance? We risk becoming like a wheel missing spokes; without enough spokes, we may never achieve what we strive for because we cannot move forward. When any foundational pillar of our existence dominates the others, we feel ungrounded and out of control. This imbalance can lead to extreme anxiety and stress, often causing us to lash out at others with anger or resentment.

This book aims to help you realign the parts of your life that may have been thrown out of whack, restoring harmony and balance. By strengthening the critical areas of your heart and mind, you can discover inner peace. When you walk and live in wholeness, you’ll be equipped to weather any storm and overcome any obstacle.

As Thomas Merton, the profound author and monk, wrote, happiness is not about intensity or striving hard to force something to happen in one area of your life while neglecting the others. Instead, it is about balance, order, rhythm, and harmony. We will briefly examine what each of these means, and I will share the secret sauce I discovered that makes wholeness possible. Ultimately, we will find that wholeness—not financial means or social status—is the true source of happiness. I have met miserable, wealthy, and successful individuals, as well as ecstatic and joyful people in the lowest circumstances. I’m not suggesting you shouldn’t pursue your dreams; I dedicated two chapters to exploring purpose and dreams as the fuel needed to pull you out of despair.

However, throughout your recovery journey, no matter where you are, prioritize achieving harmony and balance within yourself. When you do, you can find joy.

Wholeness: Not to Be Confused with Perfection

If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably believed at some point in your life that perfection is a prerequisite for success. You may feel you must have everything together at all times and be perfect in every way. However, I want to challenge that notion and introduce a richer, more profound idea of wholeness.

Wholeness occurs when the key areas of your life enrich you and support your goals of becoming well-rounded and healthy. 

Perfection is aimed at a specific goal or state we envision for our future selves, and we hold ourselves to that expectation. For instance, I might expect to be the president, a multimillionaire, or to have everything in my life in absolute balance. I aim to be healthy and wealthy, a CEO of a major company, an Oscar Award-winning director, and a Grammy-winning artist. If I don’t reach these goals precisely as I envision them, I feel like I’ve fallen short. More often than not, this drive for perfection isn’t even our own; the expectations of our parents shape it. We find ourselves striving to meet their ideals rather than pursuing our own hopes and dreams for the future. 

I previously mentioned the importance of having a purpose and setting goals. I’m not dismissing the value of the goals we establish for ourselves; they are essential for embracing life's journey and can help us become better and more vibrant individuals. However, I find it uncanny that our present selves are just as unable to predict the nature, environment, and circumstances of our future selves as we are to pick the winning lottery number. The goals we set today should not serve as our judge and executioner tomorrow. After all, we cannot be perfect. 

On the other hand, wholeness is a lifelong endeavor that requires many elements to work together, constantly challenged by the forces life exerts on us. Wholeness embraces alternative possibilities and accepts what has been given while simultaneously planning and looking forward to infinite possibilities. Fullness allows us to admit when one or more areas of our lives are a mess and open ourselves up to the grace of being imperfect while looking for solutions to bring healing. 

Achieving wholeness requires many elements working together, and it is a lifelong endeavor, constantly challenged by the shifting experiences and forces that life exerts upon us. Let’s explore Wholeness and discover how we can achieve and maintain it throughout our lives.

Balance

Our lives comprise a handful of main pillars that support everything else we do. If any of these pillars are shaky or missing entirely, the entire structure can collapse. These pillars, which we will refer to as “spokes,” include your emotions, physical well-being and health, work and career (or hobbies), finances, mental health, and relationships. To illustrate this concept more clearly, let’s consider the following diagram:  
Notice I did not put spiritual as a pillar; we will get into that later. Balance is achieved when our energy is evenly distributed or as close to evenly as possible across all of the spokes in our wheel.  

So, you find yourself out of balance; your broken relationship has caused your wheel to stop turning. You feel stuck, and the pressure from this relationship strains your emotional and mental health, leading to a loss of productivity at work. Your boss begins to notice your apathy, and this impacts your performance. You start to fear that you won’t be able to keep up with the demands of your job, worrying about losing it. This imbalance may lead to stress-eating and a decline in your workout routine.
All these losses contribute to your sense of worthlessness and fuel the nagging voice in the back of your mind: Maybe she was right to leave you. Maybe you are a failure and a loser; just look at your life. But nothing could be further from the truth. You’ve lost your balance because a part of your wheel has been damaged. As we’ve discussed, the spoke can be repaired and realigned by setting new goals, establishing personal boundaries, embracing the pain, and using it as motivation to heal. 


Support From the Inside and the Outside

You’ve heard the saying, “No man is an island,” and you’ve likely experienced times when you needed help from others. What you’re going through now is one of those times. You can draw from two primary sources to find the energy you need to “heal” the wheel. The first comes from outside yourself—friends, counselors, pastors, or family—who can come alongside you and support you until the spoke is mended. They can offer advice, temporarily fill the gaps, and walk you through the struggle. However, like you, they may also be out of balance and will run out of energy long before you’re ready to stand on your own.

Unlike the external support from friends and counselors, which is finite and conditional, the internal energy you can tap into is a limitless source of “salve”—the secret sauce that will ultimately bring you into alignment. And alignment produces order. 

Order

You are either in control of your emotions, relationships, finances, work, mental health, and body—allowing them to serve and benefit you—or you have lost control, and they dominate your life. We’ve all witnessed the unhinged behavior of those overwhelmed by their emotions. In such states, they struggle to see or hear reason, losing the ability to distinguish truth from fiction. Their emotional turmoil can lead to destructive behavior that harms relationships with those around them. It’s a sad sight, and rather than feeling anger toward them, we often feel pity because being so out of order is akin to living in hell. When we allow any of our pillars to dominate us, we make ourselves vulnerable to others controlling us. 

When money is our God, everything is about money, and all we think, eat, and sleep about is money—we risk making rash decisions that a more ordered and balanced version of ourselves would never consider. In this mindset, we might eagerly say yes to a Ponzi scheme or throw our life savings at the latest “get rich quick” scheme.  

When our health is not in order, we will lose control of our weight. Our hearts can suffer from overeating unhealthy foods, or our livers shut down from too much alcohol. We spiral out of control, and the feeling of the loss of order causes us to do more of the very thing that got us where we were in the first place. 

When we don't have proper order in our relationships, we may throw all caution to the wind. We become so dependent on being with someone that we ignore all the red flags and jump headfirst into the first relationship to come along. The result is broken relationship after relationship, and we stand there alone, wondering why everyone is so terrible. We say things like there are no good men left or there are only scheming, conniving women. 

Often, we are so desperate to get our relationships back that we throw ourselves desperately into trying to please the spouse who left. Any shred of self-respect we had left or respect from our spouse is gone. They treat us worse, and we keep trying. We allow it to happen, so they hate us all the more, and the cycle continues. 

To people on the outside looking in, it's obvious we have become unhinged lunatics, but to us, in the middle of it, we are fixing it. By doing so, we have become co-dependent. We are allowing someone else to dictate our spokes, and they are likely taking advantage of or, at the very least, mocking our shameless self-flagellation. Our lack of control over the fear of losing the relationship or being alone is causing us to lose proper order and allowing someone or something else to take control over us. We need to balance our relationship with the rest of our pillars. 

Order allows us to consider the amount of effort, energy, and value we place on any area of our lives and compare them with others. Is my relationship causing me to neglect to save for an emergency or take care of financial responsibilities? Then, it is out of order. Is my health, or lack of it, affecting my ability to be a present and active father? Then, it is out of order, and I need to do whatever is possible to bring it back into balance and reestablish order. 

Rhythm 

Maintaining control over the parts of our lives and keeping them in balance requires willpower, rather than sheer self-determined grit and perseverance, willpower is more like the ebb and flow of the tides of physical and spiritual energy. It is a dance between our spirits and minds, exchanging information from the physical and external realms to the metaphysical and supernatural world of our hearts and souls and back again. When we have peace in our minds, we can share that peace with the other spokes on our wheel. When there is a stillness and contentment in my mind, I can sync the rest of my wheel with it. 

That level of conscious and subconscious calming energy imbues the spokes with life. I allow the parts of my life that are going well to flow into the area of my life that is struggling. While the flow of energy doesn't necessarily solve the problem, it does allow healing and puts the challenge into perspective. It can take away some of the sting or offer solutions to bring change. For example, if my work is going very well, and I am being affirmed and promoted, I can take the positive experience and its affirmations and encourage the part of me that is stuck in a terrible relationship. If I am making a lot of money, I can hire a better attorney and ensure I can protect my other assets. 

If I have dozens of different relationships, I can draw encouragement from them and soothe myself with their words when my Ex is speaking poorly of me to my family. When I find a good rhythm and my mind is at peace, I can pass the wholeness I feel in the more vital areas of my life to the weaker areas. 

But what about the times when I am falling apart in multiple areas? Being good at my job isn't enough to compensate for my broken relationships, destroyed finances, and failing emotional health. There needs to be more of me to go around, plus everyone else is demanding I continue to perform at peak levels. Is there something else I can tap into to find the rhythm I need? Yes! And we'll get there soon, but first...


Harmony

Harmony is just like it sounds when the spokes in your life serve one another and operate in perfect rhythm. To increase your wealth, you must divert the energy you send to other areas of your life and focus on your finances. At other times, your relationship with the woman in your life or your kids may need extra attention; you will need to spend less time at work, take a break from a project, or set aside vacation time or a weekly date. When you are living in harmony within yourself, you will be able to notice the slight variations of imbalance and adjust the other areas of your life accordingly. A large part of finding harmony lies in prioritizing and setting good boundaries. For example, I can focus on work and landing the enormous new deal, but I will not allow my job to take me away from our family time on Sunday afternoon or date night with my wife on Friday. She will likely say it is "fine," but we all know that word means instant death. Fine means: It's not okay, and if you choose this option, you will be putting me second, and while it is "okay" this time, if you make it a habit, we will have problems. 


Understanding Yourself and Your Weaknesses

To maintain harmony, you must understand yourself. You have to know areas where you are weaker and likely to break. You have to discover pressure points, past injuries, or addictions. When considering the wheel pictured on the previous page, ask yourself the following questions for each spoke. 

Are there any unhealthy relationships in my life right now? That is a very loaded question since this book is about healing from divorce. Still, other relationships in your life may be contributing to your imbalance and may even be leading to your trouble in your relationship now. These relationships must be dealt with immediately by setting boundaries and, if necessary, terminated. 

How can you recognize these negative relationships? Do you find yourself sick to your stomach after you have spent time with the person? Is there a sense of guilt? It indicates that the person you are with encourages you to go against your internal compass. A pretty woman at the office makes you laugh, and you two get along well. It's just friends, sure, but when she casually touches your arm in passing or flips her hair behind her ear and your heart flutters, you know it's stirring something more. That might be contributing to some problems at home. 

Maybe it's friends you grew up with who didn't grow up. They are still living in the party mode past of their childhood. To them, a good night is hitting the bar, getting hammered, staying out late, missing work the next day, and wondering where all their money went. Occasionally, it might be okay, but every weekend? Those relationships will likely hold you back and keep you out of balance. It's easier for five friends to pull you off a chair than for you to try to pull them up. If they are standing in the way of where you want to go and what you want to achieve, consider limiting the time you spend with them. 

One of the most significant challenges on earth is the struggle with finances. Do you have a plan with your money? Do you know where it is going and how much you have left? With all the turmoil happening in the world, do you have a plan to save or an emergency fund? When I went through my divorce, I lost almost everything. It cost me a small fortune, and everyone wanted their pound of flesh. I couldn't afford anything more than my most basic needs after paying attorneys, doctors, expert witnesses, transcripts, child support, and all of our debts. But I planned to get out of debt as soon as possible. 

I read more about investing, setting aside an emergency fund, settling debts, and eventually paying off everything except my school loans. It took a while, but I got my feet back underneath me, and while not wealthy, I was stable and on my way to building wealth again. Know yourself: are you a spender? Make plans to save a little or pay off debt. Are you stingy? Make plans to give more to your kids or practice generosity at church or through a non-profit. If you are not in control of your finances, then your finances will control you, and every area of your life will be affected. 

Your finances are also a great place to see where you are putting your trust. Jesus said you cannot serve two masters, or you will love one and hate the other; you cannot serve both God and money. This verse is powerful and asks if we serve money as our God. Do we trust in it to fulfill all of our needs? Money is a fantastic tool, but it should never gain control over everything we do and be the sole reason we do it. It is not evil to have money, but it is problematic when we serve it above all else and sacrifice everything to get it. 

Are there areas of my life where I struggle to control my thinking? Are there times when my thoughts take over, and I obsess over problems or fears? Are there times when I cannot contain my composure because I am incapable or mature enough to do so? Do I have constantly negative thoughts about myself or thoughts of death and suicide? If you think the world would be better without you, it is a clear sign you are out of balance and harmony. I want to challenge you to consider that there has never been or will ever be anyone quite like you in all of human history. You are here for a reason and a purpose, and it is not just to suffer. It is to experience God's love and learn to share it with others. His love is significant enough to overcome anything you are facing. Don't give up! You are not the only one experiencing what you are going through.

Do you have any physical goals? Are you overweight or unhealthy? What have you done that got you to the point where you are? Can you change any of those actions to turn your health around? I cut out sugar and started working out 4-5 times weekly for an hour or so. Those two things significantly altered my emotional and mental state and gave me a new boost of confidence I needed to overcome the negative thought patterns I would slip into. I mentioned it earlier, but it bears repeating. Physical exercise is a powerful tool to expend excess energy and create space in your mind to think without being overwhelmed every waking second. 

We spent two chapters covering purpose and dreams and how to use them to alter your course. What things have you already started since you read those chapters? What has that process given you? Do the possibilities energize you? Are you overworking? Are you spending too much time working, so you are sacrificing time to rest for your health or dinner with friends? That dedication to your career is okay and excellent for a time, but like every other pillar, it must be balanced with the whole.  

I've spent much time gobbling up everything I could to challenge my mind. I read books that push me to consider my boundaries, break free from co-dependency, connect me with my history, and empower me to try. My mind has been a place I retreated to to find solace and work out problems frequently. 


What areas of your life do you think you can improve mentally, and what are your steps to improve? Have you considered returning to school, joining a club, online tutorials, or books? I spend a lot of time in traffic in Los Angeles, so audiobooks and podcasts have been my go-to for sharpening my mind. I have used reason to balance the other areas of my life and the wisdom I have gained to know when and where to shift my focus and energy. There is a great prayer I've prayed for myself since I was a child and over both of my children: that God would give me wisdom above and beyond my years. 

There is a difference between knowledge and wisdom. In the past five years, we've all seen people claiming to be knowledgeable but lacking a tremendous amount of commonsense, wisdom, and judgment. So, seek wisdom and knowledge to help you find harmony between your pillars.  Once you understand your faults and weaknesses, you can adjust your thoughts, choices, and actions to build a stronger, more balanced you, capable of handling more and being trusted with more. You will be ready for the subsequent adventure life offers, which will grant you new opportunities to find more profound balance, order, rhythm, and harmony. 



Secret Sauce

As you may have already suspected, the secret sauce is spiritual. It is foundational to the success of all other pillars and is where the energy needed to bring balance between your spokes comes from. It is why Tibetan monks can perform incredible feats of mental and physical toughness that borders on the absurd. They spend years in meditation, mastering their bodies through spiritual enlightenment. Spiritual strength is limitless because the supernatural is limitless, and we can tap into the energy of the divine and manifest it in the world around us through our words and actions. And what is even more remarkable is that you don't have to be a monk. 

Earlier in the book, I mentioned some thoughts that lead to life and beliefs that lead to death. Every day, we choose thoughts that lead to death; those thoughts inform our actions, and those actions determine our future. But what I didn't mention is the spiritual power behind every thought. 

In the center of our being is our spirit. It's like a portal or a gateway between the physical world and the supernatural unknown. Opening our soul allows other spirits and energies to pass through us into the world. If you lived through the pandemic in 2020, you know exactly what I am talking about. Something happened to the world; something changed and shifted, and the balance went out. It didn't make any sense, and the actions of friends and family only months before seemed level and sane, descended into a quasi-madness. Everyone was in shock. People started doubting one another, blaming each other for every little change. Anger flared and divided and ripped society open like a chasm. Relationships fractured, homes broke, and loved ones were lost. It was not natural. It was different from business as usual. Something had changed. Humanity had a spiritual chasm open, and what came through our collective consciousness was less than idyllic. Through our decisions and our agreements with fear and anxiety, we opened ourselves to thoughts and ideas that have led to literal death as well as symbolic demise. Despite man's attempt to declare there is nothing spiritual, we could not escape the fact that a shift far beyond our physical and mental understanding had occurred, which was terrifying. Nothing has ever been in the same since. 

So how do we know if our spirit connects with energy that leads to life or spirits that lead to death? As my father mentioned regarding words spoken over me, consider the source. As the apostle Paul said in his letter to the church in Galatia, "The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, tenderness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control." Those gifts come from the spirit of God and are readily available to anyone who accepts them. 

Consider the pillars of your life; when you think about your relationships, do you feel love, joy, peace, or patience, or are you out of control and in a rage? Are you pronouncing curses over your Ex, or are you seeking peace and operating first and foremost out of a place of love? "She doesn't deserve it!" You're right. And the truth is, none of us do because we have all, at some point in our lives, and if we are being honest, most likely daily, opened our spirits and our minds to thoughts that lead to death, destruction, selfishness, anger, rage, animosity, jealousy, greed, or betrayal. None of us could stand up to the perfect judgment of a Holy God who expects our actions to align with His purpose for us to bear fruit in our lives that leads to peace and love. 

We want justice, and that is okay. We can cry out for it and demand it. We will receive it, whether in this life or the next. But, for now, if you open your heart to it, you can receive the other gifts that help you survive and thrive through the darkest storms. They give you purpose and meaning in the most painful of circumstances and allow you to face the blows of your enemies head-on with honor and love. 

Many people may turn me off here, and that is okay; I hope you still find incredible healing through all of the work you've already done! But, if you want abiding, lasting freedom and recovery, you can only find it in the sacrifice of Christ on the cross and in a relationship with Him. He was and is the gateway that takes our dead spirits and continually opens the portal in our souls lost in darkness and gives them life. We are set free by trusting His work on the cross when He died for our sins. He resurrects us to a new life as our old self dies. We become portals through which the fruits of the spirit can flow. We can walk daily in love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control. 

Ask yourself honestly: Have the choices you made in your life so far allowed you to live in that place despite your circumstances? When I lean into my understanding, I suffer, but when I trust in a loving God who made me and knows my innermost being, I always find life. I find the ability to forgive. I learn to operate in love and to pray for my enemies. I learn to identify when someone else's actions are cursing me, and I can reject them. From the power of my spirit and the spirit of God in me, I can bring harmony to the spokes of my wheel. I can forgive. I can walk with healthy boundaries. I can have an eternal perspective and a new purpose outside of myself. 

With spiritual power, I can align myself with my goals and attract the good things because all of heaven will be attracted to the power of Christ in me. If there are still areas of my life where I am feeling anxiety and fear, it will be because I am not aligning myself with my spiritual reality. Instead, I am focusing on the circumstance and allowing it to consume me. 

I am not saying that it does not hurt. I would dare to say it hurts worse because if I know God and He is good, that means He is allowing my current suffering and not ending it quickly. That is a hard pill to swallow. But, as I mentioned before, the process of going through pain is invaluable in developing harmony within us. Overcoming strengthens our resolve and builds endurance, and endurance must work for us to become complete and mature. 

I don't know about you, but I want the fruits of the Spirit to continuously flow through me and into every area of my life. Imagine if we could all live with that kind of peace and how that would impact those around us. Wholeness will allow us to find freedom through and from our struggles. Wholeness prevents us from being overcome when we fall in any area of life. Totality will enable us to accept and embrace what is happening and let the spirit move into that area of our lives and bring healing. The skin of a scar is more robust than an uncut tissue. We are tougher, more resilient, and wiser. I walked this path, and it brought me through. Not only did I survive my divorce, but in the end, I thrived.

Food for Thought

Wholeness is what we should be striving for. It comes through work and surrender. We fight hard against the thoughts and actions in our lives that lead to death. We recognize when someone else is speaking death over us or when their actions are causing death to manifest in our lives. And we are taking those challenges to the foot of the cross and leaving them there. We surrender our healing to the open portals of our spirits, connecting us to a loving God and allowing His grace to flow through and cover the loss, the hurt, the pain, and the injustice. We surrender and let the greater power take our work and multiply its effects across every area of our lives. When it is working, that same fruit evident in our lives will pour onto others. It will be apparent to everyone we encounter. 

I had a friend once who asked me, “How are you so freaking happy all the time? You're like Barney, all like: I love you!" I told him it was because of God. I've got someone so much more prominent on my side, and I don't have to worry.
